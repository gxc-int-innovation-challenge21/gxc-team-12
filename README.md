Welcome to WINTECH, where you can find and create rides for your daily ski and hiking trips. In the Home-Wiki, we will go through the whole creating process our team managed together.

# Introduction

WINTECH is an application wanting to help the DSV create a more sustainable future for Wintersports. We want to grow together as a team and build a strong prototype above the country's borders. We will work together to bring out the best of an international, multi-field team of students.

# Problem

We figured out that an important and immediate problem that should be tackled first is the way hobby-skiers travel. Currently, They are going on their own to the mountains and have no platform to look for rides with other people, who also want to go to the same district/place. The key idea of our problem came from an issue arisen during an interview with a part-professional, daily active, winter-sports fan who is struggling with the problem we are trying to solve. We built off of this information given in the initial interview, with the rest of our interviews. Go to "Interview Section"

# Problem-solving

After synthesizing all the data we have collected about the challenge and the discussion with the challenge giver, we already knew the way to go and how to go on with the challenging part of our app. At first, our team members created an Empathy Map and wrote a Problem Statement. Go to "Empathy Map and HMW Section"

The challenge is broad and brings up different problems that are associated with it. We needed to have a clear problem statement and a better understanding of the main aspects of the problem we are solving. This made us have a big ideating-phase with the team, to get more input and other add-in options for the digital solution.

To get a clear understanding of the problem we needed to illustrate our understanding of the problem and how it connects to the idea we have selected to prototype to solve the problem! The best way to do this in order to be prepared to show to our first, possible clients was to develop a storyboard. Go to "Ideating Section"



# Prototype #
With all the collected data it was time to develop our digital prototype 1.0 
[Go to "Prototype Version 1.0"](https://github.com/gxc-int-innovation-challenge21/gxc-team-12/wiki/Prototype-Version-1.0)
With a lot of feedback from the DSV and a question-form we did with the public stakeholders we made critical and significant changes to the first Version and launched our prototype 2.0 [Go to "Prototype Version 2.0"](https://github.com/gxc-int-innovation-challenge21/gxc-team-12/wiki/Prototype-Version-2.0)


# Business Model Canvas #
Every idea needs a functioning business model if it wants to last in the long term and reach as many people as possible.  The Business Model Canvas is the tool of choice for visualizing Wintech's business model and testing whether it makes business sense.
