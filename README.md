Welcome to WINTECH, where you can find and create rides for your daily ski and hiking trips. Beside our car-sharing feature, you have the possiblity to find a community to connect to people with the same winter-sports mindset you have. 

# About Wintech

WINTECH is an application wanting to help the DSV create a more sustainable future for Wintersports. The application we create helps to share your car or find a trip to a ski-region. We also connect people with our community feature. The DSV can also use the whole community function for their professional teams, to plan the rides more sustainable and get the teams together. We are a start-up that emerged after taking part in an international student chalenge given by the Hochschule MÃ¼nchen and DSV. 

The goal of this competition was to shape a more sustainable future for winter sports fans with the help of a digital solution. After our research and the first teammeeting one potential issue that come with skiing, is the travelling to the mountains with the cars. You will find the explanation of our idea in the Storyboard below:
